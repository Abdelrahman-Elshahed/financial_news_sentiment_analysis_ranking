# Financial News Sentiment Analysis & Ranking

This project implements a comprehensive solution for analyzing sentiment in financial news and ranking articles based on their financial importance. It uses deep learning models (LSTM with BERT embeddings) and traditional machine learning approaches (Logistic Regression) to predict sentiment scores for news articles. The system is containerized for deployment, easily deployed to Azure Container Apps for scalable cloud hosting, and features CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions for automated testing and quality assurance.

## Overview

This project analyzes financial news articles to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and ranks companies based on their news sentiment scores. By processing real-time news data, the system provides valuable insights for investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions. The application architecture supports both local deployment via Docker and cloud deployment through Azure Container Apps for production environments. Additionally, the project implements continuous integration through GitHub Actions workflows that automatically run tests on code changes, ensuring code quality and functionality across the entire application.

## Features

- Text Preprocessing: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal
- Multiple Model Types: LSTM with BERT embeddings and Logistic Regression
- Sentiment Analysis: Predict positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores
- News Ranking: Rank financial news by importance
- Model Persistence: Save and load trained models and tokenizers

## Primary Model Architecture

The primary model is an LSTM network with BERT embeddings that processes financial news text and outputs sentiment scores. The architecture includes:

- Text tokenization and padding
- Embedding layer (using BERT embeddings)
- Bidirectional LSTM layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Dense output layer for sentiment prediction





## Setup

- Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman-Elshahed/financial_news_sentiment_analysis_ranking.git
   ```

## Continuous Integration

This project employs GitHub Actions for continuous integration, automatically running tests on every push and pull request to ensure code quality and functionality. The CI pipeline executes the complete test suite using pytest, validating the core components of the application:


  - Data loading and preprocessing functionality
  - Text preprocessing utilities
  - Sentiment analysis prediction accuracy


The workflow is configured in `ci-tests.yml` and verifies that all tests pass before code is merged into the main branch. This automated testing approach helps catch issues early in the development process and ensures consistent functionality across all components of the sentiment analysis system.

  - To run tests locally:

  ```bash
# From the project root
python -m pytest tests/
  ```

## Run with Streamlit Application

   - Run the combined service (API + Streamlit)
     ```bash
     cd deployment
     python run.py
     ```
  - Or run them separately
       ```bash
    cd deployment
    uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
     ```
