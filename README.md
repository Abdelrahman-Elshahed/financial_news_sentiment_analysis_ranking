# Financial News Sentiment Analysis & Ranking

This project implements a comprehensive solution for analyzing sentiment in financial news and ranking articles based on their financial importance. It uses deep learning models (LSTM with BERT embeddings) and traditional machine learning approaches (Logistic Regression) to predict sentiment scores for news articles.

## Overview

This project analyzes financial news articles to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and ranks companies based on their news sentiment scores. By processing real-time news data, the system provides valuable insights for investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions.

## Features

- Text Preprocessing: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal
- Multiple Model Types: LSTM with BERT embeddings and Logistic Regression
- Sentiment Analysis: Predict positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores
- News Ranking: Rank financial news by importance
- Model Persistence: Save and load trained models and tokenizers
- Experiment Tracking: Track experiments with MLflow
- API Deployment: Serve predictions through FastAPI
- Web Interface: User-friendly interface with Streamlit
- Containerization: Docker support for easy deployment



## Primary Model Architecture

The primary model is an LSTM network with BERT embeddings that processes financial news text and outputs sentiment scores. The architecture includes:

- Text tokenization and padding
- Embedding layer (using BERT embeddings)
- Bidirectional LSTM layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Dense output layer for sentiment prediction





## Setup

- Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman-Elshahed/financial_news_sentiment_analysis_ranking.git
   ```
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Set up dependencies

  Install Python dependencies:
  To install all the required Python packages for the project, run the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Run with Streamlit Application

   - Run the combined service (API + Streamlit)
     ```bash
     cd deployment
     python run.py
     ```
  - Or run them separately
       ```bash
    cd deployment
    uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
     ```
